Improve Add Employees UI

user stories
As a user I see a page with three inputs: one is labeled 'Name', 'Position', 'Salary'

the top of the page has a title - add an employee

under the tittle, we see a list of current employees
When I fill in inputs and I click the submit button, the new employee appear in the list.
If I add an empployee with filling in the inputs I get an error message asking me to go fill the inputs.
